# Seven-databases

Homework for "Seven databases in seven weeks" book. So this is the neo4j week ...

## Install

On Mac

    brew install neo4j

Else go [there](http://neo4j.org/download/)

## Day 3

### Find

1. [Neo4j licensing guide](http://neo4j.org/licensing-guide/)
2. [What is the maximum number of nodes supported?](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/questions.html#idp41176464)

### Do

There's no code here.

1. Nothing to complicated, just follow what is described in the book but you don't need to change port because we use different servers.

2. Using Apache Proxy Load Balancer, just follow the [manual](http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/security-server.html#_security_in_depth). Howere, there's an issue about url substitution in the web admin console [here](https://github.com/neo4j/community/issues/581). No problem when using the REST API.


## TODO

*  [] Use more JUNG algorithm with transilien graph but in java this time.
